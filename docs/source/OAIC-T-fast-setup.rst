About OAIC-T
------------

OAIC-T is an open-source AI cellular testing platform which supports automated, distributed, and AI-enhanced testing of xApps in O-RAN.
The OAIC-T framework consists of three major components: i). Test Input, which includes both test configuration and test script files, 
ii). the Server, which sets up the testing environment as described in test configuration files and orchestrates the test execution as 
defined in test scripts, and iii) the Actor(s), which executes test actions as instructed by the server.

The server manages a number of remote testing actors, including maintaining the socket connection to each actor and monitoring its resource 
usage (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, and SDR hardware) and test status. 

One actor consists of the actor manager, AI core, and test executor, as well as two adapters to interface with the unit under test 
(i.e., a cellular radio network controller). Each actor can interact with xApps/rApps under test through either the SIM Adapter or the 
SDR Adapter. The SIM Adapter acts as a testing xApp/rApp which can be deployed in a non-RT, near-RT, or RT RIC to send testing data and 
receive response to/from the RAN through socket communications. The SDR Adapter acts as a user equipment (UE) which leverages SDR-based 
software suite (e.g., srsRAN) to send radio testing signals to the RAN through antennas.
