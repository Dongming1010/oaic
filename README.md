# Experiment Setup and Documentation

This repository contains the necessary instructions and tools to successfully set up and reproduce the experiment using OpenAI Cellular (OAIC) platform.

## 1. Official OAIC Tutorial

To get started, follow the official tutorial provided by the OAIC team for setting up and running the experiment in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment:

This tutorial will guide you through the basic setup, prerequisites, and configuration steps.

## 2. Our Notes and Adjustments

For successful reproduction of the experiment, we made a few adjustments to the official tutorial setup. These adjustments helped us overcome various issues and achieve the desired results. You can find a detailed description of our notes and the steps we followed to successfully reproduce the experiment in the following document:

## 3. Automation Script for Experiment Setup

To ease the process of setting up the experiment, we created an automation script that handles the setup of the xApp, BS, UE, and connection checks. This script simplifies the configuration and deployment process and reduces the time required to get the system up and running.

You can access the script and a detailed guide on its usage here:
